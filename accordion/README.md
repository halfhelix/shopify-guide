# Accordion

This accordion is for use with page content set in the Rich Text Editor. It uses H2's as toggles by default. Its styles are customizable, and so are the toggles.

## Installation

Paste the `accordion.liquid` snippet into your `snippets/` folder.

Include the `accordion.liquid` snippet into the page template or your choice. For example, in `page.faq.liquid`:

```
{% include 'accordion' %}
```

Include the default styles from `_accordion.scss` into your stylesheet, however you prefer.
